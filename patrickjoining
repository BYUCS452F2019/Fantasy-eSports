I would want to work on this project because I enjoy watching E-sports, specifically League of Legends. The fantasy system that they had 
was kind of clunky so i think it would be cool to make my own. 

I am split on back or front end, I want to learn elements of both. So id be happy to do either. Since I have familiarity with how E-sports
work and what stats or info a person would want to know, I feel I can be helpful to the project.

For business side of these things, I think it should be a free system, let people use this for their enjoyment.

Legal: Utah LLC? I dont know too much about legal stuff.

Technical: The main elements I know we will need to figure out is.
Data Pulling: Pulling the data about players from the correct sources to fill out our database
Player Query and Comparison: Allow users to compare multiple players on a variety of statistics to help them make an informed choices.
Users Teams: Be able to create the teams user have, and have them visualy be able to see stats.
Update Data based on matches: keep everything up to date.
