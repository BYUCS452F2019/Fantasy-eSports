# Fantasy-eSports
Build your ideal team, compete with your friends, and stay up to date on the latest in eSports

# Description
eSports is growing massively every single year with teams winning enormous cash prizes and competitions being viewed by more people than watch the NBA finals or the Super Bowl.  Fantasy eSports has been attempted before but crumbled under legal issues and complexity.  We will aim to create a simple platform to create your leaque with your friends, draft your team, and update stats with real competition data so that you can compete with your friends.  We'll also aim to incorporate a calendar and social space so that individuals can keep up to date with current events in the eSports world.

# Team
Looking for around 5 individuals with experience on either end of the spectrum to build a fully fledged team.  I don't have a set game plan for architecture or platform and am completely open to all team member ideas.

# Business
Integrating with teams and focusing on simple, relevant advertising will allow us to grow our audience and create revenue for our company.

# Legal
Let's see where this goes and make a company if we can.

# Technical
Will make architectural choices as a team for front-end and back-end.  Will focus on proof-of concept first and then work on getting real-time data and incorporating actual calendars for competition times.
